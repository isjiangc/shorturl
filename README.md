# Nunu — A CLI tool for building Go applications.

Nunu is a scaffolding tool for building Go applications. Its name comes from a game character in League of Legends, a little boy riding on the shoulders of a Yeti. Just like Nunu, this project stands on the shoulders of giants, as it is built upon a combination of popular libraries from the Go ecosystem. This combination allows you to quickly build efficient and reliable applications.
